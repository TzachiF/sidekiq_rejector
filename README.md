The simple way for rejecting jobs when code introduced with unwanted behavior(bug) and there is a must to stop handling this type of jobs until
a fix is issued. 

## Requirements

Only sidekiq 3 is supported.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sidekiq-rejector'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sidekiq-rejector

## Usage

All that you need in case you want to exclude jobs is to configure two environment variables  

SidekiqRejectorEnabled = true  

SidekiqRejectorValues = <comma separated string> with values of the method to stop (when called using delay) OR the worker name.  
 
There is also a utility class that will remove jobs directly from Redis. This is for a situation were a huge amount of jobs already queued and they may clog the background workers.

Inputs: queue_name - The target queue that you want to clear  
        string_identifier - The method name OR worker name, using this identifier the jobs are found.    
       
```ruby
SidekiqRejector::JobRemover.remove(queue_name, string_identifier)
```
